<h3>Name</h3>
MAI - Collection of weather data
<p>

<h3>Defined in Task</h3>
Task 5.1: Plant Digital Twins with ML/AI
<p>

<h3>Short description</h3>
<p>The MET API Interface (MAI for short) is a user interface to FROST, the API developed by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET) which enables public access to weather data. MAI is a software bundle written in Python and is intended to be used as a standard Python module.</p>
<p>The purpose of MAI is to simplify data retrieval from FROST by providing a streamlined user interface. A user can select a location, a time interval, and a series of measurements, and MAI takes care of contacting the correct access point in FROST, submitting a properly composed request, and receiving and handling the response. MAI allows querying FROST for three main purposes: 1) Retrieve all available weather-stations names in a given area (at municipality level); 2) retrieve a list of all available measurements at a selected location or municipality; 3) retrieve all data available for the selected measurements at a chosen location and time interval. The weather data is collected in a properly formatted Pandas DataFrame for ease of use.</p>
<p>The modularity of MAI allows for flexible development and extension of its features.</p>
<p>

<h3>Example of usage</h3>
<p>To allow MAI to access FROST, a user must first register and receive its client ID. This is done visiting <a href="https://frost.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html">https://frost.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html</a> and registering with an email address. MET's API <a href="https://frost.met.no/termsofuse2.html">terms of use</a> as well the <a href="https://www.met.no/en/About-us/privacy">privacy statement</a> hold in this steps.</p>
<p>After registration, weather data can be retrieved by a user in one simple call to MAI. The figure below illustrates a minimal usage example.</p>

<h3>Interfaces</h3>
The software is intended to be run as a standard Python module, imported in a script and run either in terminal or in a notebook. Most functions contained in MAI accept as input location names, list of measurements, and time intervals (or a combination of those). The returned output can be either messages on the screen containing the requested information, or a Pandas DataFrame containing the weather data, formatted with timestamps in rows and the different measurements in columns. Errors are handled through descriptive explanations and suggestions to the user.
<p>

<h3>Subordinates and platform dependencies</h3>
MAI is available on any platform that can run Python 3.x.
